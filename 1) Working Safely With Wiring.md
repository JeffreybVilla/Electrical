Typical amount that flows through the wires in your home can be fatal if you contact it directly.

There are about 50,000 electrical fires each year causing 450 deaths, 1,500 injuries, and 1.3 billion dollars in property damage.


# How Electricity Works
    Compare to home's plumbing system.
    Electricity & water enter home and are distributed through home, do "work", and exit.

    In plumbing, water first flows through pressurized water supply system.
    In electricity, current first flows along hot pressurized wires.

    Electrical pressure is called voltage.

    Large supply pipes can carry more water than small pipes; large electrical wires carry more current than small wires. 
    Electrical current-caryring capacity of wires is called ampacity. 

    Water finally leaves the home through a drain system that is not pressurized.
    Electrical current flows back through neutral wires and is not pressurized and is at 0 volts. 
    !!!!!!!! Don't assume the neutral is at 0 volts, defects can put voltage on the neutral wire. Treat it as hot wire until proven otherwise.!!!!!!!!
